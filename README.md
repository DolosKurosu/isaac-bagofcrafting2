# isaac-bagofcrafting2
Generates a bag_of_crafting_recipes.txt file using BladeCoding's isaac-bagofcrafting code as the base. Major credit to him for all of his crazy work on the bulk of this code. This will work with modded itempools.xmls and item-metadata.xmls. 

Note: The itempools.xml was taken from Item Pools Rework mod to use for testing. 

## How To Use
1) Open this project on VSCode.
2) Replace the itempools.xml and/or item-metadata.xml in the `assets` folder if generating recipes for a mod.
3) Go to index.js in the `src` folder, and press `CTRL` + `SHIFT` + `grave` to open up a terminal.
4) Type node src/index.js.
5) Wait ~15 seconds and done. File made.
